# Installation

To install the library just move the `include` folder into a proper place, e.g.
`/usr/local/include` on Unix-alike systems.

# Example

To build the examples, one need the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) program.

To build all the examples, one need the
[vDist](https://github.com/zhouyan/vDist) library, [Intel Math Kernel
Library](http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl/), [Intel Threading
Building Block](http://threadingbuildingblocks.org/),
[Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and
[Boost](http://www.boost.org/). However, only the last two are required, others
are optional.
